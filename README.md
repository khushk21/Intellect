# Intellect

# 1. Introduction
Intellect is a game that intends to gamify and socialize teaching and learning of software engineering courses and provide Teachers with an easy and convenient way to check on their Students’ progress and adapt the game to each Student’s needs. It consists of two separate applications, the Intellect game for the Students and web application for the Teachers.

Students would have access to the mobile app, where they would be able to play the game itself. The primary features in the game are: Solo Campaign mode, Challenge mode and Assignments. Solo Campaign mode is the main feature of Intellect, with Students aiming to defeat all the monsters in a stage within the time limit. Students would answer questions relating to software engineering correctly, thus educating them on that particular topic. Challenge mode would allow Students to design a level of their own and challenge other Students to compete with themselves in the level that they created.

Teachers would have access to the web app, where they are able to observe the status of Students currently under them, with a summary report for each world, inclusive of the number of Students who have cleared the world, currently attempting to clear the world or have not tried the world. Teachers would be able to design and send Assignments to Students which they would have to complete. Teachers would, thus, have a better understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of each Student based on which question each Student consistently got wrong. The Teachers are also in charge of account management for the Students.
